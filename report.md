# Homework1 report

TA: try to elaborate the algorithms that you implemented and any details worth mentioned.

There are two functions don't match the given results. They are policy evaluation in value_iteration and compute_vpi. For policy evaluation, in order to let state 14 have correct policy, I add the reward back. Because the problem of compute_vpi, the oher functions using it also have some incompatibles. However, the results generate by these functions are still quite close to the given ones.

I learned a lot from this homework and Jupyter is a fine platform.
